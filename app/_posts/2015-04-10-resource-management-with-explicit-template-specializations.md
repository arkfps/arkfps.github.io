<span class="drop-letter">H</span><span>ereâ€™s</span> my article from the [April
2015 issue of Overload journal][url-overload]. It presents a simple,
easy-to-use, generic RAII wrapper based on an interesting static polymorphism
technique which I introduced in the [previous post][url-previous-post].

## [Resource Management with Explicit Template Specializations][url-overload-article]

> [RAII][url-raii] is one of the most important and useful C++ idioms. RAII
efficiently relieves the programmer of manual resource management and is a must
for writing [exception-safe][url-exception-safety] code. Perhaps, the most
ubiquitous usage of RAII is dynamic memory management with
[smart pointers][url-smart-pointer], but there are a plenty of other resources
for which it can be applied, notably in the world of low-level libraries.
Examples are Windows API handles, POSIX file descriptors, OpenGL primitives,
and so on.
